                    <strong>"I used to be a pack rat. ."</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I 
                    loved,but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.

                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, 
                    and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                    <strong>"I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything."</strong> I literally put
                     90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit 
                     my job.It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what 
                     else to do. And it worked.

                    Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
                     more, and I have more free time to enjoy.

                    With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how 
                    I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started
